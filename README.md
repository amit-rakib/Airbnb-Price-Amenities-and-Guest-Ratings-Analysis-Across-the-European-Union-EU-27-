**Source:** Airbnb.com (public search results pages)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzed how property features, amenities, and guest ratings influenced nightly Airbnb prices across the 27 EU member countries. Data was collected from **five cities per country** using **Selenium in Python**. The goal was to uncover patterns in high-value stays, identify drivers of price variation, and highlight which factors most strongly influenced Airbnb pricing across Europe.  

## 📊 Dataset  
A total of **2,521 listings** were collected from Airbnb search result pages, and after data cleaning, **2,521 listings** remained. Each entry included nightly price, property type, location, number of reviews, guest ratings (accuracy, cleanliness, communication, value), and amenities.  

## 🏡 Amenities Analyzed  
The dataset included amenities across multiple categories: scenic views, bathroom, bedroom and laundry, entertainment, heating and cooling, privacy and safety, internet and office, kitchen and dining, outdoor, parking and facilities, and services.

## 🔍 Analysis Focus  
The analysis explored average nightly prices across countries and cities, identified the top five most expensive and bottom five cheapest cities, and ranked countries based on both **Price & Guest Reviews** as well as **Price & Amenities**.
